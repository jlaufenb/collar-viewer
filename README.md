# GPS Collar Viewer
An R shiny app for visualizing and summarizing GPS collar data. Users upload a RData file. These data are imported and a summary table is produced that includes includes collar id, study site, current fix interval, and first and last fix dates. Users can view a leaflet map of the dataset (subsetted to one fix daily to increase processing speed) and subset the data by study site, id, age class, and sex. Users can view fix locations and home ranges (minimum convex polygon, kernel and Brownian Bridge) of the subsetted data.

## Instructions
`if (!require("shiny")) install.packages("shiny")`  
`shiny::runGitHub( "collar-viewer", "jlaufenb", ref = "dev", launch.browser=T)`
